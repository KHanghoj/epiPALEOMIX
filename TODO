meeting with TOBIAS 2015-23-11:
- We decided to published with EM-calling
- send him gccorrection
- might use a binomial distribution to correct background instead of what we use right now
- try to print the read weight across a nucleosome
- What is the GC-enrichment difference within a nucleosome. I think it is very similar.

meeting with ludovic 2015-20-11:
- check methylation levels on chromsome 1 with 15 basepair read - done. chromsome 1 is 0.008 in contrast to 0.005 for occu methyl and 0.010 for unoccu  -  goode.
- check delta s of mapdamage for CTCF-Unoccy and CTCF-occy. 0.02 for unoccy 0.015 for occy. goode
 - this is interesting since we see a 2X higher methylation level in unoccy than occy.
- in pedersen et all they smooth the value per 25 basepairs, sum(deamin [-12:12])/sum(cov [-12:12]) per position. it smoothes everything much more, that is likely why we see the peaks surrounding the drop of the dyad that they didn't find in pedersen fig 4E.
- make a plot with the CpG % across -+ 100 of all the called nucleosomes. - done. only peak in center -+ 25 bp
- overlap plot of CpG density across nucleosomes with methylation level. It shows that the peak in methylation at the ends a sequence of a nucleosome is not related to CpG density. Cool.
- check that the peak surrounding the drop of methylation is not just because of the CpG present in in center of a dyad using GC-correction stuff.

meeting with Ludovic 2015-19-11:

- call Tobias:
 - We are on time pressure
 - you'll (Jakob and Tobias) be included in the paper
 - Still want to finished the model, but we need to submit
 - Need to find a way to make it work on many nucleosomes - and use the maximum read length.
 - Will be included in next publication
- Finalize WIKI and TUTORIAL then send to L
- make methylation vs nucleosome score across top 1% called nucleosomes to see methylation drop towards dyad and nucleosome increase
 - Do it as a profile -120;+120 of a dyad
 or
 - as bars if less precise
 - do it on all samples
- Make all samples with occupied/unonccupied CTCF plot 
- extract lambda estimates from mapdamage (high - short overhang) (low - long overhang)
 - Can we correlate that with
 - make a linear model coverage ~ delta s * lambda val
 - check if first peak in methylation is 10-bp periodicity that comes from preference of break for every 10 base pair
 - take the downsampled bam file where the 200bp peak in methylation is still higher than the noise. 10 bp peak might not be noise so some other peak. 
- for nucleosome calls we decided to use delta instead of log-scores

- if long overhang you need less probability of getting a hit per base than for short overhang reads. long overhang samples might have clear CTCF pattern even for low delta s samples.
- download new data from eppie and remember to include MOTA african sample from now on
- PhD plan confirmation together with ludovic


- ideas to later
 - make a model of CTCF binding sites and predict the 50000 whether occupied or unoccupied
 - this could be something possible only in ancient DNA not in modern stuff



- get nucleosome calls from Tobias and liftover to hg19 and use these as test. Hope to see something similar - kris
- scan genome + plus some simple peak-calling - Tobias
- gamma and lambda - Tobias
- get version check of pysam and numpy - kris
- compiling cython to both mac and linux systems - Jakob might have some experience with that
- setup.py + compiling cython if needed
- upload example to ftp:
 - /k/ftp-data/OrlandoGroup - done
 - make a folder and add { TEST.bam, reference genome fasta, yamlfile, bedfile} 

- do reservoir sampling for read length (min, max)

- git fork paleomix github
- virtual environment. use that not to cause problems with already existing versions of Paleomix.

- send documentation and example to ludovic
