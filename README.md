# epiPALEOMIX

A Fast, Accurate, and Automatic pipeline for generating nucleosome and methylation maps from high throughput sequencing data underlying ancient samples.

## Brief description

The epiPALEOMIX pipeline proposes tools for generating two epigenetic regulators of expression data from ancient samples using high-throughput seqeuncing data by benefiting from natural _post-mortem_ degradation processes affecting the DNA. The pipeline takes BAM-format files as input containing the aligned reads underlying an ancient sample.
